It's a great thing; the way social media has allowed us to express solidarity with causes that touch our hearts. I fear however, that a problem arises when private web companies like Facebook, with such an expansive reach into our personal lives, have a potentially manipulative ability to control which of those causes its users can most easily show a unified support of. As a result, such an organization can highly influence how its 3 billion users are likely to determine the importance or urgency of those causes. The Click Solidarity project is a ~24 hack project that attempts to return some of that control to users. The project provides a highly currated set of overlays users can apply to their social media profile to show support of a variety of causes-- causes that larger news outlets may not be endorsing. Prominent causes will be represented on the site by an overlay illustrated by a graphic designer. Ideally, the illustrated overlay would be commissioned by a reputable organizational sponcer of that cause.
